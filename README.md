## When we hit https://www.techtonic.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions.

Clicking the url refers back to a DNS server that then points to an IP address (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) for the data that you are requesting. Once located and accessed, this information from the server is transmitted into your browser in the form of an HTML file for your browser to interpret and display. As an added feature, http(S) has been granted a secured certificate.

## From start to finish how does that data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

By clicking the url, your web browser (client) has asked a DNS server to communicate the request to an IP Address. This IP address is a location/computer (server) on the internet that contains the requested information. The server responds with access and transmits the data back to the client in the form of an HTML file. The client/browser then interprets the code in this file into a functional webpage that may or may not be styled or have dynamic functionality.

## What code is rendered in the browser?

HTML is the code that is rendered in the browser. CSS and JS are also code that can be accessed from this web document and displayed in the browser. While the code is intended to be invisible and only the content is portrayed in the browser window, the source code can be viewed if needed.

## What is the server-side code’s main function?

The server-side code's main function is to deliver content requests by the client that access information on the server for an interactive experience. This can be accessing databases, webpages, scripts, or other data stored in the server.

## What is the client-side code’s main function?

Client-side code's main function is to process information provided from the server on the clients computer. If it is source code, then the client must have the language enabled, and in turn translate this information in the browser.

## How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.) are created?

As many as allowed by the client. Client side processing and cache storage can be determined by the user.

## How many instances of the server-side code are available at any given time?

As many as allowed by the server. Processing power and bandwidth usage can play a factor. These can also be manual settings to allow for only a certain number of instances at any given moment.

## What is runtime?

A period of time that a code runs.

## How many instances of the databases connected to the server application are created?

Many instances of databases can be created accessing or manipulating data to perform tasks.

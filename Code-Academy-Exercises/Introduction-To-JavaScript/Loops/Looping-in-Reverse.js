// The loop below loops from 0 to 3. Edit it to loop backwards from 3 to 0
for (let counter = 3; counter >= 0; counter--){
  console.log(counter);
}


// We can set a loop to run in reverse as well. This can be useful if the stopping point would be reached faster by going backwards from the starting point

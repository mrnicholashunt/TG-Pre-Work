// Write your fasterShip object literal below
let fasterShip = {
  color : 'silver',
  'Fuel Type' : 'Turbo Fuel'
};


// Object literals are created by using {}. for example let doodle = {}; This creates an object now we need to assign key-values to this object. We put these inside the curly brackets key: value. Multiple key values are seperates by a comma

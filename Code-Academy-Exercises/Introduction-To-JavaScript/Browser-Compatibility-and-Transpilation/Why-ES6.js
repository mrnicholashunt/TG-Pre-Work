var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

var meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

var sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
var carbonara = "You can make carbonara with " + pasta + ", " + meat + ", " + " and a sauce made with " + sauce + ".";


// ES6 addressed bugs in ES5, made code more readable, and made it more similar to other coding languages to make it easier to learn and understand by non js developers
